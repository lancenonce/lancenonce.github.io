I think it would be best for the collective to have a society where everyone is in the interest of all. However, historically, it's been challenging at best to ask humans amongst each other to (particularly Americans) to care about others. This is due to the incentives that are propped up in American society.

You see, the American is encouraged to be a consumer. A product-buying machine whose sole purpose is to make a few producers rich. The richer they get, the more powerful they become, the more ability they have to alter opinions and thus the choices of the masses. For example, Coca Cola's ads feature some of the happiest looking human beings, though, the pop itself kills you slowly. However, due to the happy marketing, the inexperienced mind's (children's) opinion fixates on that product producing that certain desirable emotion. They grow up thinking it is making them happy, alwhile the beverage is making them obese and killing them slowly.

Coca Cola is acting in its best interest. In the rules of a society based on state-endorsed, military-enforced capitalism, one shall, indeed, kill another for profit. That's, what I think, it means when the Declaration says that "all men are created equal," of course we are. Even though there were enslaved people, I still think they meant that all men (not sure about humans, they were misogynists) are created equal. It just depends on what you do to survive. In a capitalist society, those with guns rule. Those with the power to alter opinions and choices rule. Yesterday, it was guns, germs, and steel. Today, it's digital technology, attention, and culture. We need something to balance the playing field, quite desperately. 

Those who have had control for a very long time want to extract every ounce of value from the majority of humanity and the earth. They want to keep squeezing until they reach billions, trillions, quadrillions, quintillions, sextillions, septillions, octillions, nonillions of dollars, then they'll just want a bit more. When will it end?

My case for blockchain is this: we need a tool that can enable us to use technology as a tool, not as a llifestyle. Please don't quickly jump to conclusions here, my mind also flew to "wearable technology?" "voice AI technology?" "neuralink?" The solution here is simple: change society's incentives. The incentive now is to take. Change the incentive to giving. 

What is money, in particular, currency? A unit of exchange for value. When you use sacred numbers to start playing games with value (I.e. Wall street and the entire financial system), you are no longer respecting the value of all. 

I'm not talking about a cryptocurrency or anything you see in the blockchain market today. I'm speaking of a concept of social credit where your career is centered around human development. You grow up being an apprentice to the adults. Rather than forcing them to attend school for indoctrination, treat them as if they are adults earlier (with the same consent rules) and have them on the job early. 

I think the reason there's a job shortage is because American people aren't trained to work jobs. They are trained to go to school. To receive information and do nothing with it. This is due to a capitalist vampire that needs to extract the life (current, currency) out of as many as possible for as long as possible. As long as the people in power need college students paying bands on bands for social validation, they will not stop EVER. With they crazy asses. We have to stop participating in it. 

No malls, no clubs, no big grocery stores, no big ads, low imports, maximum production. Right now I think I could do it if I was in the right environment. We need a safe space. This is where I think humanity should go. Keep the technology as a tool. If the technology of 100 years from now, all powered up to sell you to as many businesses as possible, is calculated with the scale of innovation today, no way we won't all be enslaved. No damn way. 

So let's cut to the chase. We need to reprogram ourselves. We need leaders who won't pander us for votes. Leaders who will be honest and transparent with us. Let's learn how to be humans again. Let's start working for each other again. Let's start building something that really works and not something that feels good to the ego of the kings and oligarchs.
