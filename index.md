I have a deep inner sense of justice. I like to think and write about technologies that can be used to free people. To free people from the clutches of *corrupt* governments, economic structures, religions, and other mind-altering systems. 

For quite a while, I put a filter on my deepest opinions and ideas. However, I'm a man now, so sit back, relax, and explore the ideas I post here.

Before taking anything personally, I urge you to talk to me. Click on my social media profiles and send me a message. I will respond over time.
