This is my page. It's not professional, nor is it unprofessional. It's not work, nor is it play. It just is.

Now, read the blog and enjoy my favorite poem by Rumi:

> Our death is our wedding with eternity.
>
>What is the secret? “God is One.”
>
>The sunlight splits when entering the windows of the house.
>
>This multiplicity exists in the cluster of grapes;
>
>It is not in the juice made from the grapes.
>
>For he who is living in the Light of God,
>
>The death of the carnal soul is a blessing.
>
>Regarding him, say neither bad nor good,
>
>For he is gone beyond the good and the bad.
>
>Fix your eyes on God and do not talk about what is invisible,
>
>So that he may place another look in your eyes.
>
>It is in the vision of the physical eyes
>
>That no invisible or secret thing exists.
>
>But when the eye is turned toward the Light of God
>
>What thing could remain hidden under such a Light?
>
>Although all lights emanate from the Divine Light
>
>Don’t call all these lights “the Light of God”;
>
>It is the eternal light which is the Light of God,
>
>The ephemeral light is an attribute of the body and the flesh.
>
>…Oh God who gives the grace of vision!
>
>The bird of vision is flying towards You with the wings of desire.
